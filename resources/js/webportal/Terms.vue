                            Credit session validity may vary depending on the credit purchase pack you commit too and/or membership plan you sign up on. It is your responsibility to ensure your credits are always active in line with their terms of validity, unused credits that pass their validity end date will hold no further value and cannot be transferred or used against any Heba Product.
                            We have Sessions running continuously across all open hours of our studios and each Nuforma machine is available to book independently within each studio location.
                            Sessions are subject to availability and we do not guarantee that spaces will be available in any given Session, even if you have sufficient Credits in your profile account.
                            You may cancel a booking up to one hour before the Session and receive a refund of your Credit. If you cancel less than one hour in advance, you will not be eligible for a refund, except in exceptional circumstances (you may be required to provide evidence to support your cancellation rationale).
                            If the Session time you wish to attend is fully booked, you may choose an alternative time with remaining spaces.
                            If we cancel a Session time slot for any reason, if you have made a booking and used a Credit, your Credit will be refunded.

                            Health Commitment Statement.
<br><br>
                            By signing up to any membership, package, program, Service and/or attending any sessions, events or any other activities and using any Heba Pilates studios, NuformaTM machines and/or equipment, you acknowledge that you are responsible for participating in health and fitness activities, sessions and guidance safely and on behalf of yourself and at your own risk.
<br><br>
                            We will respect your personal decisions, and allow you to make your own decisions about what exercise you can carry out. However, we ask you not to exercise beyond what you consider to be your own abilities. We will make every reasonable effort to make sure that our equipment and facilities are in a safe condition for you to use and enjoy. If you tell us that you have a disability which puts you at a substantial disadvantage in accessing our equipment and facilities, we will consider what adjustments, if any, are reasonable for us to make.
<br><br>
                            By engaging, attending and participating in Heba Services, as detailed in our Terms of Service, you acknowledge and take full responsibility for your behaviour as a user of Heba Pilates. You must behave sensibly and follow any guidance and safety instructions we may give so as not to hurt or injure yourself or others.

                            Ensure that you have no medical or physical condition that would put you at risk when using equipment in our studios or participating in sessions.
                            Where relevant you will seek advice from a qualified doctor, physician or medical practitioner in respect of your participation in our sessions and, where required or requested by Heba, provide a copy of such advice.
